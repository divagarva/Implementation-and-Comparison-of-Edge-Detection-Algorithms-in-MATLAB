# Implementation-and-Comparison-of-Edge-Detection-Algorithms-in-MATLAB
 This project implements various edge detection algorithms, including Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts, and Canny, using MATLAB. The objective is to identify image boundaries by detecting significant intensity changes. Each method is applied to grayscale images, and their performance is visually compared.
